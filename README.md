# quadraticEquationSover

This was done by Paul Lockett and Dominic Ducre.

Paul Wrote this readme, did the handwritten notes, and the Parser

Dom set up the website, wrote the lexer, solution component, and the checker.


Created with CodeSandbox and can be seen at the link below

Use this by going to the website and tying a quadratic equation like: -1x^2+50x+20
